# BugMeNot-safari-extension

An unofficial Safari extension for BugMeNot.com that provides usernames and passwords to bypass compulsory registration.

The extension adds a button into the toolbar that you can click to bring up a list of usernames and passwords for the current page, provided by [BugMeNot.com](bugmenot.com). This is great for bypassing free but compulsory registration on sites like The New York Times and The Washington Post.
